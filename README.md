**What is Sparta Remixing?**

Sparta Remixing is a type on online media where someone uses a certain video/source (Examples being SpongeBob Squarepants, My Little Pony: FIM, and etc.) and edits it in a remix based off the meme "300 This is Sparta: Fun Times Mix" which uses the movie 300 and was created by Keaton Monger.

Sparta Remixes have advanced dramatically within the past 15 years it has existed. It started out as an often FL Studio only form of media until it has advanced to the point where most remixers use at least Vegas Pro, FL Studio, and Melodyne. This tripples the quantity of software!

**What's the software used?**

The software that most remixers use is Vegas Pro (versions ranging from 13 to 19), FL Studio 20, and Melodyne/VocalShifter LE.

**Setting up FL Studio 20**

Install the regular installer, and then the patch.
